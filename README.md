# üè¶ Loan Eligibility Predictor

This project is a web application built with Streamlit that predicts loan eligibility based on various applicant details. It uses a Logistic Regression model trained on a loan approval dataset.

## üåü Features

* **Interactive Web Interface:** User-friendly interface built with Streamlit to input applicant details.
* **Real-time Prediction:** Instantly predicts whether a loan application is likely to be Approved (1) or Not Approved (0).
* **Model Performance Display:** Shows key performance metrics of the trained model in the sidebar:
    * Accuracy Score
    * Confusion Matrix
    * Classification Report
* **Data-Driven Insights:** Utilizes a dataset (`loan_approval_dataset.csv`) to train the prediction model.
* **User Guidance:** Includes clear instructions on how to use the application.
* **Error Handling:** Implements checks for data loading and input validation.
* **Clean UI:** Designed with a minimalistic and user-friendly aesthetic.

## üíª Technology Stack

* **Python:** Core programming language.
* **Streamlit:** For creating the interactive web application.
* **Pandas:** For data manipulation and preprocessing.
* **Scikit-learn:**
    * `LogisticRegression` for the classification model.
    * `StandardScaler` for feature scaling.
    * `train_test_split` for splitting the dataset.
    * Metrics (`accuracy_score`, `confusion_matrix`, `classification_report`) for model evaluation.
* **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** For plotting the confusion matrix.

## üìä Dataset

The model is trained using the `loan_approval_dataset.csv` file. The key features used from the dataset for prediction include:

* Number of Dependents
* Education Level (Graduate/Not Graduate)
* Self-Employment Status (Yes/No)
* Annual Income
* Loan Amount Requested
* Loan Term (in years)
* CIBIL Score (Credit Score)
* Value of Residential Assets
* Value of Commercial Assets
* Value of Luxury Assets
* Value of Bank Assets

The target variable is `loan_status` (Approved/Rejected).

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup and Installation

1.  **Clone the repository (if you've uploaded it to GitHub):**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/daniyalismail/Loan-Eligiblity-Predictor.git](https://github.com/daniyalismail/Loan-Eligiblity-Predictor/tree/main#)
    cd your-repository-name
    ```
    (Replace `daniyalismail/Loan-Eligiblity-Predictor` with your actual GitHub repo details)

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```
    Activate the environment:
    * Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
    * macOS/Linux: `source venv/bin/activate`

3.  **Install the required Python libraries:**
    ```bash
    pip install streamlit pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
    ```

4.  **Dataset:**
    Ensure the `loan_approval_dataset.csv` file is present in the root directory of the project (the same directory as your Streamlit Python script, e.g., `app.py` or `loan_predictor_app.py`).

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run the Application

1.  Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
2.  Make sure your virtual environment is activated (if you created one).
3.  Run the Streamlit application using the following command:
    ```bash
    streamlit run loan_predictor_app.py
    ```
    (Replace `loan_predictor_app.py` with the actual name of your Python file, e.g., `loan_predictor_app.py`).

4.  The application will open in your default web browser.
